            Humanity worldwide is continually developing new technology. Innovations such
            as the telephone, TV, and internet permanently change global communication, and
            adoption of novel technology is very disproportionate between countries.
            <p>
            Throughout the history of technology adoption documented in our dataset, a
            country's GDP is strongly correlated with how quickly it is able to adopt
            its use of a technology per capita. However, particular smaller countries like Japan and Germany
            often acquire technology disproportionately quickly.
            <p>
            Scroll on to see how these trends manifest throughout communications technology in the 20th century.

    <div style="font-size: 9pt; font-style: italic;">
            All y-axes are log scale and describe the total number of devices in a given country in a particular year.
            We chose not to do technology per capita, because the rate of technology acquisition is not related to
            a country’s population.
            <p>
            The issue with relating the two is particularly noticeable with the extremely
            populous China and India, where a large segment of the population is less privileged with access to new
            technology. Measuring technology per capita causes those countries to score very low compared to the rest
            of the world. On the other hand, technology acquisition showed a strong correlation with country GDP.

            <h3>Invention of the Telephone</h3>
            <p>1876 saw the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in the USA, who later visited
                Japan personally in 1877 to demonstrate the technology. [2]
                From 1876, the USA led the world in telephone use, reaching as many as 180 million telephones in 1980
                while the rest of the world adopted telephones much more slowly. In particular, Japan had
                the next most telephones, at 48 million when the U.S. reached its peak.</p>
            <p>1876 saw the invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in Boston, USA, which other countries soon
                rushed to replicate [1]. The most successful countries of the century in telephone acquisition were the USA
                and Germany, who had rapidly set up commercial telephone manufacturing by 1877 [2]. The USA led the world in
                adopting telephones with 1.3 million telephones by 1900, while Germany came in second with 306,000.

            <h2>1920</h2>
            <h3>Invention of the Radio</h3>
            <p>
            Radio was patented in 1896 by Guglielmo Marconi, and the world began to develop applications for
            this novel long-range communication technology. In particular, the 1910s saw the development
            of entertainment broadcast stations, radio communications for aircraft, and even the early stages
            of television, using radio to broadcast images.</p>
            <h2>1980</h2>
            <h3>First commercial radio broadcast</h3>
            <p>
            “On November 2, 1920, station KDKA made the nation's first commercial broadcast
            (a term coined by Conrad himself). They chose that date because it was election day,
             and the power of radio was proven when people could hear the results of the Harding-Cox
              presidential race before they read about it in the newspaper.” [1]

            <h3>First commercially available cellular phone</h3>
            <p>
            Though the world’s first cellular network had already been launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and
            Telephone in 1979, it was not until 1983 when commercial cellular phone communication became available.
            The first 1G network was launched in the USA by Chicago-based Ameritech, shortly followed by the DynaTAC
            8000X, Motorola’s first commercial portable cellular phone.  [5] In the following graphs, the USA’s and
            Japan’s early access to cellular phone technology is clear, though Germany is quick to catch up by 1986.

            <h2>1989</h2>
            <h3>Invention of the World Wide Web</h3>
            <p>
            The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, an English contractor at CERN in
            Switzerland. Berners-Lee, in particular, was the first to use computer networking technologies and markup
            languages such as HTML to create an international, publicly-accessible network for sharing information. The
            early adopters of the Web were academic research institutions who were peers of Berners-Lee and CERN and
            quickly published research work as well as webcomics and animated images. [7]
            </p>
            <p>
            The creation of the internet predates the World Wide Web by many decades, and internet innovation was
            primarily concentrated in the USA with collaborators in the UK and in France [6]. However, by 1995,
            it’s clear that Germany and Japan are once again disproportionately ahead of with Internet users
            relative to their GDP, while the USA is a full order of magnitude ahead with 25.2 million users
            compared to Japan and Germany’s 2 million.

            <h3>The Fall of the USSR</h3>
            <p>
            The fall of the USSR in 1991 causes a distinct anomaly in the trend of world superpowers dominating
            technology acquisition. The USSR's radio usage drastically falls post-1990, coinciding with a jump
            upwards in China's usage.</p>

            <h3>Fall of the Soviet Union</h3>
            <p>1992 on wards</p>
            <p>
            A noticeable quirk in the dataset is related to the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. On a
            significant number of technologies, Russia (considered to be the same bucket as the Soviet Union
            in this dataset) dipped significantly in technology usage starting 1990. While it is known that
            multitudes of Soviet  engineers and scientists left Russia following the dissolution of the USSR [8],
            a more likely explanation is that pre-1991, the “Russia” label of the dataset included the entire USSR.
            On the other hand, post-1991 it only includes the country of Russia and none of the sovereign states
            formed after the USSR’s collapse. The following graphs of population vs. GDP and population vs. year
            corroborate this guess, since it’s clear that the population of “Russia” dips after 1991.
            This dip is also apparent in the earlier graph about radio usage.
