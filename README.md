**NOTE ABOUT THE SUBMISSION**
Elina submitted seperately from the initial group “megkiilina”

The narrative and dataset remain the same as with the original group “megkiilina” but .

**About the dataset**

The dataset includes over 100 technologies in its collection, but many of the technologies have very sparse data across all the countries and years. We decided to focus on communications inventions because it seemed to follow naturally from thinking about worldwide adoption of technology, plus the data for 20th century communications inventions was some of the most dense available in the CHAT dataset.

**Website and Graphs Interactions**

My webpage is divided into two columns, left containing a continuous stream of contents that reacts to the scroll, and the right containing an interactive world map. A row of sections on the left column denotes the sequence in which we wanted to show the technology, and the map is updated accordingly as you scroll down. Each country on the map is color encoded based on the data of the technology and the year of interest. The exact numbers of the data and the name of the countries are presented as a tooltip as you hover over the country, while fading the rest of the countries. Also, the toggle button on top of the color legend allows the viewers to switch between the number of technology users and the ratio of the technology to GDP to show the discrepancies between the growth in GDP and the distribution of technology.
